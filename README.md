## Accents demo

This is an example using aws mobile, to create an accents app!  

To get started clone the repository!  
Then run `awsmobile init`, this will create your own mobile project and configure the resources specified in `mobile-hub-project.yml`.

After that you can run `awsmobile run`, to launch a local copy of the app!
